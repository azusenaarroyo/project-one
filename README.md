* Reducing crime
* Allocating law enforcement in different areas
* Determining predictors of crime

## This week everyone should
Get familiar with data
Database and cleaning process- Aaron Hall, Azusena Arroyo
Someone should looke into machine learning model- Daren Garcia
Relevant data and feature engineering Azusena Arroyo, Charla Garcia

## Future Steps
Use SQL alchmey to pull data into database
Once you clean data through pandas, push data back into database: Data cleaning will include: Parsing date by date of the month and/or season, other suggestions welcome. Drop columns
Assumption: We will make the assumption that the incident happened within 2 weeks of reporting date.
Machine learning model will be a classification or clustering model - Multivariate linear regression for the types of crime type. Can also use random forest.
Look at predictions
