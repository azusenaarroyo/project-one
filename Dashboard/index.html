      <p class="lead"; style="font-size: larger;"> We are interested in learning about the 
        crime profile in the City of Austin and if we can identify predictors of crime. Moreover, our machine learning model will attempt to predict what type of crime 
        will occur. We collected data from the Austin Police Department (APD) from the years 2003 to present. It contains a record of incidents that the APD 
        responded to and wrote a report on. Of all crimes reported the highest offense per incident was documented in
        one of the six crime categories below.   </p>

    <!-- Create table of crime types and definition-->
    <h2>Crime Categories</h2>
    <p> The crime data is categorized into 6 categories based off the 
      National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The NIBRS is an incident-based reporting system used by law enforcement agencies 
      in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. </p>
