      <h2>Crime Categories</h2>
      <p> The crime data is categorized into 6 categories based off the 
        National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The NIBRS is an incident-based reporting system used by law enforcement agencies 
        in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Of all crimes reported the highest offense per incident was documented in
        one of the six crime categories below. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Theft: The unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property
          from the possession, or constructive possession, of another person. </li>
        <li>Burglary: The unlawful entry into a building or other structure with the
          intent to commit a felony or a theft. </li>
        <li>Auto Theft: The theft of a motor vehicle</li>
        <li>Aggravated Assault: An unlawful attack by one person upon another wherein the offender
          uses a weapon or displays it in a threatening manner, or the victim suffers obvious severe or
          aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal
          injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness. This also includes assault with disease (as
          in cases when the offender is aware that he/she is infected with a deadly disease and
          deliberately attempts to inflict the disease by biting, spitting, etc.). </li>
        <li>Robbery: The taking, or attempting to take, anything of value under confrontational
          circumstances from the control, custody, or care of another person by force or threat of force
          or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear of immediate harm. </li>
        <li>Murder: The willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human
          being by another</li>
